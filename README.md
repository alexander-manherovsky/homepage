### - Hello, people!
My name is Aleksander and this is my very own personal website. Basically this is just a résumé.
I've decided to host it with [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), because it was requirement of my first task in Binary Studio Academy ))
Creating this page I used good mood and some [**Bootstrap**](https://getbootstrap.com/).

_Thank you for coming!_
